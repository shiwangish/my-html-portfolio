<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shiwangi, a budding web developer on a mission to turn creative ideas into awesome websites. I'm passionate about crafting digital experiences that look great and work even better.</p>

<p>I've been learning the ropes of web development, diving into the worlds of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring ideas to life. I love the challenge of making websites that not only look cool on your laptop but also on your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>When I'm not glued to my computer, you'll find me exploring the latest web trends and trying out new coding tricks. I believe in teamwork and good communication, so I'm always ready to collaborate and turn visions into reality.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I enjoy working with:
  <ul>
    <li>Building with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    <li>Learning about: New web tech and design trends</li>
    <li>Excited about: Making websites that everyone can enjoy</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet. If you have a cool project in mind or just want to chat about web stuff, shoot me an email at shiwangi.sh20@gmail.com . Let's create something awesome together!</p>
<p>Cheers, <br/> Shiwangi
